1. Purpose
This plugin allows users of the webmail frontend to enable 
and disable their exim4 vacation message. They can also edit 
the text of the message. A recipients database can be deleted 
upon activation of a vacation message.

2. Basic function
The plugin does not process any mails and send messages. It 
relies on a properly configured exim vacation transport and 
router. The exim router must require a file to start sending 
vacation messages. The plugin must be configured to the same
path for the active message as the exim router's require_files
option.
The transport can use a recipients database for exims once 
option. An existing old recipients database can be deleted on 
activation of the message.

3. Configuration
- Set exim4 up to send vacation messages when a vacation file is 
present (require_files option in your router).
- Set paramters in config.inc.php in the pugin directory:
$rcmail_config['exim_vacation_mailboxes_root'] 
Your servers  root directory for mailboxes. The plugin will add 
the user name to this folder to find the user folder which 
contains the vacation message folder. Your php script (aka your
webserver) needs at least the execute privilege on this folder
E.g: If you have system users for your mail, set this option to 
"/home". If you have virtual users, use your virtual users root.

$rcmail_config['exim_vacation_subfolder']
The folder which contains your vacation message and recipients
database. Must belong to the user exim4 is using to access it and
to the group your php scripts are running under (usually your 
webservers group). Both user and group need rwx permissions!
E.g: If your user is called "john", your root set above is 
"/home", and you set ".vacation" here, the full path will be:
/home/john/.vacation"

$rcmail_config['exim_vacation_msg_active']
The file that triggers exim's vacation router

$rcmail_config['exim_vacation_msg_passive']
The file to use to store the message text while the vacation
message shall not be sent. Can be any valid file name different
from above.

$rcmail_config['exim_vacation_recipients_db']
The file name for the recipients database set by the "once" 
option in exim's vacation transport configuration. Exim must
write this file into the same folder as the vacation message
for this function to work, plus it must set the "mode" option in
the transport to 0602 (add the line: mode = 0602)
